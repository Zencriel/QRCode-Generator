I needed to make QR codes for some activities at university and I used CustomTkinter to make a quick GUI app that can be easily used to convert links into QR codes.
I was honestly tired of hosting QR codes on some website with a bunch of ads so I quickly coded this up.

Next, I will probably make this an executable so I can run it anywhere.
